# Authoring

Watchcraft authoring is a Python toolchain that turns source media, transcripts,
and analysis into versioned collection packages. Authors may clone this repository
and run the tools locally; authoring is not required by the reader application.

`prototype/` contains the current command-line implementation. Its collection
compiler writes the portable collection manifest and an optional CSV export;
all presentation and local-library access belong to the React readers and the
Tauri desktop adapter.

The authoring output must validate against `packages/catalog-schema` and must not
contain absolute paths to an author's media files.
